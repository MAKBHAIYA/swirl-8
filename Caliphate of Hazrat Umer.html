<h1><ins>Hazrat Umer</ins></h1>
    <p>
        Hazrat Umar ibn al-Khattab (رضی اللہ عنہ) was born into the powerful and respected
        Adi clan of the Quraysh tribe in Makkah. Known from a young age for his strength,
        courage, and sharp intellect, he was a natural leader and a man of strong principles.
        Initially a strict opponent of Islam, his heart changed when he embraced the faith,
        after which he became one of the Prophet Muhammad ﷺ’s most devoted companions.
        Hazrat Umar (رضی اللہ عنہ) was renowned for his fearlessness, honesty, and unwavering
        commitment to justice. He strongly supported the Prophet ﷺ and played a crucial role
        in defending the Muslim community during times of persecution.
        As a companion, Hazrat Umar (رضی اللہ عنہ) was known for his disciplined character,
        courage in battle, and devotion to the welfare of the community. He accompanied the
        Prophet ﷺ in numerous military campaigns, demonstrating remarkable bravery and
        strategic skill. Despite his formidable presence, he was humble and devoted in worship,
        showing deep respect for the Prophet ﷺ and concern for the needy
        When Hazrat Umar (رضی اللہ عنہ) became the second caliph of Islam, he brought
        transformative leadership to the growing Muslim state. He implemented systems of
        governance, justice, and public welfare that ensured fairness and accountability for all.
        Hazrat Umar ibn al-Khattab (رضی اللہ عنہ) is remembered as a fearless, just, and
        visionary leader.
